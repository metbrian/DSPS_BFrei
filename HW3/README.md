This is the DSPS HW3 submission folder.

Collaborators: Brian Frei and Miguel Pedrazo.

Break-down of work: 
Brian set up the initial data read-in and selection based on stationary and non-stationary time periods.
Miguel wrote a shorter method for filtering out non-stationary, and wrote the code to reproduce table 1 from Corral/produce cumulative probability dist.
Brian edited figures, added labels, titles, and captions, and wrote the analysis throughout the project.
