This is the readme file for HW2 DSPS in Brian Frei's repository metbrian/DSPS_BFrei. Both of the notebooks should be able to be run in their entirety on Google Colab.

Collaborators: Brian Frei, Miguel Pedrazo
Contributions: Brian Frei completed assigment 1 (Boltzmann), and both Miguel and Brian worked on assignment 2 (central limit theorem). Miguel wored on most of the coding for assignment 2 (calculating means, gaussian fit etc), and Brian worked primarily on the plot labels and descriptions.
