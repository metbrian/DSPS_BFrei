Explanation:
This was an image that I produced for my undergraduate thesis research on wind ramp events. I was trying compare the number of a certain type of ramp events in 2015 and 2016 but the way that I produced the image automatically created the y-range, which ended up being different for each year. In the updated image, I tried to get rid of this skewed/biased aspect of the image by combining the two datasets into one figure with the same y-range. Additionally, I added two separate colors to clearly differentiate between the two years. Finally, I added gridlines to be able to clearly tell exactly how many events occured on a given month and year, which could be difficult otherwise, especially towards the later part of the year.
